Project Proposals - Cecily Sperber

Idea One
1. Title
Impacts of Recycling Knowledge on Contamination Rates

2. Justification


3. Hypothesis
Higher levels of public knowledge about recycling standards are associated with lower contamination rates in recycling waste systems. 

4. Methods
To gather data for this project we would use datasets from EPA recycling surveys and the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Waste and Recycling Statistics. The spatial scale will include national data from the EPA (United States) and DEFRA (Uk). The temporal scale will cover the most recent 5-10 years of available data to analyze trends over time. We will conduct a corelation analysis and possibly a time series analysis.

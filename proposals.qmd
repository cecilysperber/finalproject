# Project Proposals - Cecily Sperber
# Idea One
1. Title - Impacts of Recycling Knowledge on Contamination Rates

2. Justification - Proper recycling pactices are cruical for effective waste management and environmental sustainability. A large portion of the population lack the sufficent knowledge about recycling practices which leads to high contamination rates in recycling waste systems. A study done by @rosenthal2021effects found that tailoring information can complement physical changes to promote proenvironmental actions by people. Another study by @avadi2022trace found that repeated application of properly recycling agricutlural waste can dramtically boost contaminantion levels. 

3. Hypothesis - Higher levels of public knowledge about recycling standards are associated with lower contamination rates in recycling waste systems. 

4. Methods - To gather data for this project we would use datasets from EPA recycling surveys and the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Waste and Recycling Statistics. The spatial scale will include national data from the EPA (United States) and DEFRA (Uk). The temporal scale will cover the most recent 5-10 years of available data to analyze trends over time. We will conduct a corelation analysis and possibly a time series analysis. 

5. Expected Outcomes - We expect that regions with higher public knowledge of recycling methods will have significantly lower contamination rates in recycling waste systems. This is important because high contamination rates reduce efficiency of recycling programs, increase costs and can lead to more landfill. 


# Idea Two
1. Title - Impacts of Forest Management Practices on Biodiversity in Temperate Forests


2. Justification - Forests are a crucial ecosystem for biodiversity conservation but forest management practices such as logging and thinning have significant effects on the composition of forest ecosystems. Specifically in temperate forests, these management practices are often used to improve timber production or fire suppression but their effects on biodiversity are not well understood. A study by @sing2018review showed that a diversity of management practices is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity. Another study by @bernes2015impact believes that active management can be relevant where lost ecological values need to be restore therefore conserving biodiversity. 


3. Hypothesis - Forests managed with selective logging or controlled burns have higher biodiversity than forests that are clear-cut or unmanaged, due to the retention of habitat diversity. 


4. Methods - To gather data for this project we could use datasets from the Global Forest Watch, USDA Forest Service, Forest Biodiversity Network, and/or Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The scope of the study will focus on temperate forests in North America, Europe, and/or Mexico. We will conduct a regression analysis to test for significant differences in biodiversity between management types. 


5. Expected Outcomes - We expect that forests managed with selective logging or controlled burns will show high biodiversity compared to forests that have been clear-cut or unmanaged. This study can provide use with valuable information for developing forest management practices that balance both biodiversity conservation and timber production/fire risk management.

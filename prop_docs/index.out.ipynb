    "\n",
    "1.  Title - Impacts of Recycling Knowledge on Contamination Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - Proper recycling pactices are cruical for effective waste management and environmental sustainability. A large portion of the population lack the sufficent knowledge about recycling practices which leads to high contamination rates in recycling waste systems. A study done by Rosenthal and Linder ([2021](#ref-rosenthal2021effects)) found that tailoring information can complement physical changes to promote proenvironmental actions by people. Another study by Avadı́ et al. ([2022](#ref-avadi2022trace)) found that repeated application of properly recycling agricutlural waste can dramtically boost contaminantion levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - Higher levels of public knowledge about recycling standards are associated with lower contamination rates in recycling waste systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - To gather data for this project we would use datasets from EPA recycling surveys and the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Waste and Recycling Statistics. The spatial scale will include national data from the EPA (United States) and DEFRA (Uk). The temporal scale will cover the most recent 5-10 years of available data to analyze trends over time. We will conduct a corelation analysis and possibly a time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - We expect that regions with higher public knowledge of recycling methods will have significantly lower contamination rates in recycling waste systems. This is important because high contamination rates reduce efficiency of recycling programs, increase costs and can lead to more landfill.\n",

    "# Idea Two\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Title - Impacts of Forest Management Practices on Biodiversity in Temperate Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - Forests are a crucial ecosystem for biodiversity conservation but forest management practices such as logging and thinning have significant effects on the composition of forest ecosystems. Specifically in temperate forests, these management practices are often used to improve timber production or fire suppression but their effects on biodiversity are not well understood. A study by Sing et al. ([2018](#ref-sing2018review)) showed that a diversity of management practices is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity. Another study by Bernes et al. ([2015](#ref-bernes2015impact)) believes that active management can be relevant where lost ecological values need to be restore therefore conserving biodiversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - Forests managed with selective logging or controlled burns have higher biodiversity than forests that are clear-cut or unmanaged, due to the retention of habitat diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - To gather data for this project we could use datasets from the Global Forest Watch, USDA Forest Service, Forest Biodiversity Network, and/or Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The scope of the study will focus on temperate forests in North America, Europe, and/or Mexico. We will conduct a regression analysis to test for significant differences in biodiversity between management types.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - We expect that forests managed with selective logging or controlled burns will show high biodiversity compared to forests that have been clear-cut or unmanaged. This study can provide use with valuable information for developing forest management practices that balance both biodiversity conservation and timber production/fire risk management.\n",

    "1.  Title - Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Pollinator Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - Pollinators are essential for biodiversity and agricultural productivity, yet their populations are declining due to habitat fragmentation (Potts et al. ([2010](#ref-potts2010global))). Habitat fragmentation occurs when large habitats are divided into smaller, isolated patches, disrupting resources such as food and nesting sites and leading to declines in pollinator abundance and diversity. (Hadley and Betts ([2012](#ref-hadley2012effects))). Understanding these effects is crucial for conservation efforts because as pollinator populations decline, they directly affect food security and biodiversity. This study aims to assess the relationship between habitat fragmentation and pollinator diversity across different ecosystems, providing insights into habitat management and restoration strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - Habitat fragmentation reduces the diversity and abundance of pollinators by limiting food resources, decreasing habitat connectivity, and disrupting pollination networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - A way to research and analyze this hypothesis is to use peer-reviewed studies focusing on habitat fragmentation and pollinator diversity. One resource that we could use is the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Pollinator Research Program, which provides data on pollinator populations, distribution, and environmental stressors. Another dataset could come from NASA’s Land Cover and Land Use Change (LCLUC) program, which assess habitat fragmentation and land use changes. By integrating these datasets, we can assess how pollinator diversity is affected by habitat fragmentation in different ecosystems. A statistical analysis could then be used to estimate effect sizes and identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - Habitat fragmentation is likely to have a negative impact on pollinator diversity, leading to a decrease in species richness and abundance. Understanding this issue is important because pollinators play an essential role in biodiversity and ecosystem stability. By identifying trends across different ecosystems, the findings could provide insights for conservation efforts to support pollinator resilience in fragmented habitats.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Title - Impact of Climate Change on Bird Population Dynamics in the Rocky Mountains\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - Rising temperatures and altered weather patterns are affecting bird habitats, influencing food availability, migration patterns, and breeding success (La Sorte, Tingley, and Hurlbert ([2014](#ref-la2014role))). Mountain ecosystems, in particular, are more vulnerable to climate change because species are forced to shift to higher elevations to maintain suitable conditions. These shifts can lead to increased competition, habitat loss, and population declines. Understanding how climate variables influence bird population dynamics in the Rocky Mountains is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Long-term monitoring of bird populations and climate data can reveal how species respond to environmental changes, providing valuable insights for future land management and conservation efforts (Rushing et al. ([2020](#ref-rushing2020migratory))).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns will result in shifts in bird species and declines in cold-adapted or climate-sensitive species.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - To assess the impact of climate change on bird populations, we can first use bird population data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), which provides long-term observations of species abundance and distribution (https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/). We can filter this dataset for bird populations in the Rocky Mountains over 10-20 years to track population trends and species distributions across this region. The second dataset will come from NOAA and show temperature and precipitation records. We can then filter this climate data by year and region to assess how climate variables (temperature and precipitation) have changed over the selected time period. Using both datasets, we can conduct statistical analysis to examine the relationship between climate variables and bird population trends. This will allow us to better understand how climate change influences bird populations in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - We expect to find that climate change, particularly warming temperatures and precipitation, influences bird population trends in the Rocky Mountains. These changes may lead to shifts in species composition, with some species declining due to habitat loss or altered migration patterns. The results will inform conservation strategies to protect vulnerable bird species in a changing climate. \n",

    "1.  Title - Identifying Correlations between land-use change and habitat fragmentation through mountain lion activity\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - humans have been a reckoning force on the Earth, especially when it comes to how we use/exploit the land. As we expand our reach through agricultural and infrastructural endeavors, ecosystems are damaged and reduced in size. Nagendra, Munroe, and Southworth ([2004](#ref-nagendra2004pattern)) discusses research around human land-use changes and how they are causing global change. This had me thinking about what animals could be at risk from human land-use. Mountain lions are an interesting study when it comes to this. Since they are a pinnacle of mountainous food webs, their habitat degradation could have many affects on the ecosystem says Riley et al. ([2014](#ref-riley2014individual)). It is worth quantifying how humans affect ecosystem food webs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - Places with dense road networks and higher populations will cause more habitat fragmentation among Puma concolor (mountain lions)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - study mountain lion data (movements, counts, deaths) and how they correlate between areas of high human activity (i.e. urban to suburban) to places of low human activity (i.e. national parks and rural areas). This study will need land cover data (Google Earth Engine, MODIS) over a period of time, mountain lion tracking data (LTER), and human census data. We will conduct analysis and hopefully fit a model that shows us if their is a positive, negative, or no correlation between land-use change and habitat fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - we should expect that human-dense areas are going to cause higher rates of fragmentation among mountain lions. Exploring this topic will allow us to find better ways to preserve territorial habitats and hopefully spark initivtive to save other species that suffer from the same issue.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Title - How does pollinator abundance affect agricultural production?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Justification - pollinators offer humans a priceless ecosystem service, one that would be detrimental if lost. As humans continue to influence climate change, biodiversity loss has been an important issue in light of pollinator conservation. Now, we are more dependent on pollinators than we have ever been says Aizen et al. ([2008](#ref-aizen2008long)). Pollinators have large impacts on the economy as well: Allen-Wardell et al. ([1998](#ref-allen1998potential)) states recent crop failures and adverse seasonal weather have been detrimental to the agricultural economy. To sustain an overgrowing population, we need to understand how systematically pollinators affect crop yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Hypothesis - areas of higher pollinator presence are going to have larger and more bountiful yields than areas with low to no pollinator presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Methods - to test this hypothesis, we need to find pollinator data (USDA and LTER) that includes variables such as abundance, species, and population growth/loss. For agricultural data, we can use USDA yield statistics and location data to join the pollinator data. The techniques we will use will be correlation analysis and ML regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Expected Outcomes - areas with better pollination will show greater crop growth due to higher fertilization rates. Being able to understand the dynamic between crop and pollinator is beneficial to the agricultural industry and food prodcution around the world.\n",
